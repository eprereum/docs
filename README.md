# Eprereum

Eprereum is a network to build the computational capacity of Ethereum applications.  Requests for computation are made by Ethereum applications.  Results are computed by the Eprereum network and rewarded to Eprereum nodes on Ethereum.

The Eprereum network stands in service of the Ethereum network.  In this sense it leverages the security properties of the Proof-of-Work miners and in return provides scalable computational ressources to Ethereum applications.

Results are computed asynchronously and accepted over a meta-consensus layer.  This can additionally enable Ethereum smart contracts to read-write to external distributed systems like IPFS or IPDB.

## project status

These are very early days.  There are no full-time resources yet dedicated; some of the foundational ideas have been put on paper (in this repository [WIP pdf](https://github.com/eprereum/docs/blob/master/docs/eprereum.pdf)).
